# bang
## wut
bang is a realistic feel-bad-about-pixels simulator created in 2010.
## license
bang is GPLv3 because yes. all art is CC BY-SA 4.0 but really the art is just a few sprites and a background composed of like three colors so if that's really something you desperately need but absolutely cannot know that you took it from somewhere else i don't really care.
## why
because those pixels are people too
## want to make changes?
i don't know why you would want to do that this is a 5 year old poorly written flash game but if you feel compelled to improve it feel free to, i'll probably accept whatever because this project is dumb
